â›” DEPRECATED. This example was deprecated.

Starting from v24.2.1, the [DxTabs](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTabs) component implements tab Close buttons. Set the `ShowCloseButton` property to true and handle the `TabClosing` event to close tabs. 

The current repository will not be updated in the future.
