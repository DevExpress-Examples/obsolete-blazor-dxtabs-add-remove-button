â›” DEPRECATED. This example was deprecated.

Beginning with v24.2.1 and onward, the [DxTabs](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTabs) component implements tab Close buttons. Set the [ShowCloseButton](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxTabBase.ShowCloseButton) property to true and handle the [TabClosing](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTabs.TabClosing) event to close tabs. You can try this functionality in the [Tabs - Scroll Mode](https://demos.devexpress.com/blazor/Tabs#ScrollMode) demo.

The current repository will not be updated in the future.
